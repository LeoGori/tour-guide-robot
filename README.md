# Tour Guide Robot

[![Docker Images CI](https://github.com/hsp-iit/tour-guide-robot/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hsp-iit/tour-guide-robot/actions/workflows/main.yml)

#### The Dockerfile(s) can be found [here](https://github.com/hsp-iit/tour-guide-robot/tree/master/docker_stuff).

##### Some applications don't behave nicely on yarpmanager (ex gazebo due to clock), so they are run separately with a .sh file.

for more information see the [wiki](https://github.com/hsp-iit/tour-guide-robot/wiki)
